#  CS230 â€“ Deep Learning (Stanford)

Welcome to my random but real notes for **CS230: Deep Learning** from Stanford University.  
This repo is basically my digital notebook â€” all written inside gihub, tested, broken, fixed, and re-tested ðŸ˜‚  
Everything here is part of my learning journey in deep learning, and Iâ€™ll keep updating it as I go.

## ðŸ§¾ About This Repo

Iâ€™m using **VS** as my main workspace.  
here you will find: 
- My summaries in Markdown  
- Code experiments in PyTorch/TensorFlow  
- Notes about what worked, what didnâ€™t  
- A bit of chaos but useful chaos  

All notebooks are synced with GitHub so I donâ€™t lose progress.
