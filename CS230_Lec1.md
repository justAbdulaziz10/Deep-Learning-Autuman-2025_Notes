### tructured vs Unstructured Data
- **Structured data:** Google Sheets, Excel, relational tables.  
- **Unstructured data:** text, audio, images, video.  

---

### Models and Modalities
- Models like **GPT** excel at **text-in → text-out** tasks because they were trained mainly on language.  
- Other modalities (audio, images, video) use specialized deep-learning architectures directly instead of language models.  

---

### Prompts and Generative AI
- For text tasks, prompting alone can get you far — but not to the finish line.  
- **Generative AI** is inexpensive and ideal for **rapid prototyping**.  

---

### On Data Scale
- Knowing how to apply deep learning helps you fine-tune and build **smaller, efficient models**.  
- Sometimes **100 data points** are enough; other times you need **100 billion — and still want more**.  

---

### Productivity & Innovation
- A **sandbox environment** boosts speed and creativity.  
- Building prototypes **10× faster** and developing production software **30–50 % faster** means more innovation.

### Core Principle
**Move fast and be responsible.**
